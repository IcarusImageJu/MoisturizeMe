# MoisturizeMe
Project to explore Arduino capabilities.

This project can water your plant based on a settable minimum % of moisture in a soil. The plant will be then watered for a period of time that you can define too. The programm will only water the plant for max 1* per hour to let the soil absorbe the water and be stable for another reading.

If you add the screen you will see your moisture % on it and also if the plant is asking for water and if your water system is running.

Check the [wiki pages](https://github.com/IcarusImageJu/MoisturizeMe/wiki) to know how.
